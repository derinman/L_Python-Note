-concurrency libriray in python: Multiprocessing, Threading, AsyncIO
    (read: Multiprocessing VS Threading VS AsyncIO.pdf)

-Multiprocessing for CPU-Bound
-Threading, AsyncIO for I/O Bound

-Multiprocessing: 
    Multiple processes
    high CPU utilization

-Threading:
    Single process
    multiple threads
    pre-emptive multitasking
    OS decides task switching

-AsyncIO:
    Single process
    single thread
    cooperative multitasking
    tasks cooperatively decide switching

-AsyncIO
    single thread
    using coroutine(協程) accomplish concurrency
    'yield from' is old lagecy(before py3.4), 'yield from' is like 'await' in AsyncIO
    see img 'yield from subgenerator.jpg'
